**ISOLDE Solenoidal Spectrometer (ISS) - Nuclear Structure Measurement Tool**

**Overview:**
The ISOLDE Solenoidal Spectrometer (ISS) is a cutting-edge device designed to measure nuclear-structure properties of nuclei formed in transfer reactions. These reactions involve the transfer of individual nucleons between a beam and a target in a single step. Within a strong solenoidal magnetic field, charged particles follow helical trajectories, enabling strategically placed detectors around the beam axis to measure the energies and positions of these particles. This data extraction allows for the characterization of properties in the residual nucleus's populated states.

**Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to create a web-based tool that facilitates the selection of viable reactions for measurement using the ISS device. By providing real-time feedback, this tool empowers users to fine-tune various parameters of their experiments. Key factors to simulate include detector positioning, magnetic field strength, expected reaction rate, and angular distribution of ejectile particles. Additionally, consideration of effects that broaden the widths of states in an excitation-energy spectrum is crucial. Armed with this information, physicists can develop proposals that are more likely to succeed, significantly contributing to our understanding of nuclear structure.

**Benefits of the Tool:**
1. **Enhanced Experiment Design:** Users can optimize experimental parameters, leading to more successful proposals at ISS.
2. **Real-time Feedback:** Researchers receive instant feedback on the impact of their choices, allowing for rapid adjustments.
3. **Greater Impact:** By making informed decisions, experiments are better poised to yield valuable insights into nuclear structure.
4. **Versatile Application:** The tool's flexibility caters to a wide range of experimental scenarios, accommodating diverse research needs.
5. **User-Friendly Interface:** The web-based platform ensures easy accessibility and usability for both experienced and novice researchers.

We envision this web-based tool to be a valuable asset for all future proposals at ISS, significantly benefiting the scientific community and advancing our understanding of nuclear structure.
